          &nbsp; &nbsp; Hey there, you may be reading this right now at night or the next morning since I'll be the one to greet you last (kind of). So... Happy Birthday to the person I admired the most :> How have you been? Did you enjoy your day? If so, good to know!! You'll be probably wondering why I didn't greet you early but I rather greet you at Night :> So that you can peacefully read this letter that I made in HTML.  
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; I did tell you that I've been doing a project recently and I'll show it to you when it's done. Well, here it is :> I'm not really good at expressing things so I hope you understands. My gift for now is an appreciation letter and some moments we did back then playing codm? I'll give you something soon if we ever meet up again :> So here we go.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know when or how I started to like you back then. But I can say for sure that you inspired me to do better in studies. I’ll be ashamed if I can’t be in the same or similar level as you. At first, the things I like about you is that you're really pretty and smart. I also like your writing, it was easy to read and looks neat compare to mine that looks like a different dimension language that only I can understand. We barely talk in school and since I'm a coward that time. I do find it hard talking to you in person because I easily get nervous that time so yeah... I made of you as my inspiration to keep going and take school seriously. Although, didn't managed to nail getting in the same section as you :>
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Fast forwarding since we lost connection that time and barely meet each other since we have our own life during those times. Well at that time, I'm at my character development phase by doing new things I normally don't do (e.g., reporting, leader, joining events). We did stop talking, but I never said that I lost my feelings for you. Well, I still don't have the courage to talk to you and since we really have no things to talk about since I guess we became stranger again that time.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Time goes by and I still don't have the chance to talk with you and you’re not really active that much on Facebook. Well surprisingly, I stumbled upon that you have a Twitter account and made sure it was actually you lol. Somehow, I can talk to you again? but not that much as before since I still don't have the courage to do it yet... Good thing, that your birthday was already near and I may have the chance to talk with you with that and I did greet you at night since I expect that the celebration is already over :> This time, I took the risk to talk with you by making "Happy Birthday" as an excuse to talk again. It was successful though.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; I get to know you this time and I'm actually glad that I took the risk than lose the chance. At first, I thought myself that we really don't have anything in common to talk about but I guess it was just my thoughts? The fact that we both like the same Ice cream flavor and hated mint flavor. As for the things I like about you this time, I like how you seem to enjoy to share your memorable stories with me that involves your friends and families. I like how you don't hesitate and comfortably to tell it to me. I like how every story was very detailed and feels like I'm re-reading a manga that I like so much on because of how good it was. I like how hardworking person you are. I like how happy you are from just listening to you. I like how you're not scared to tell me your problems even though I'm not good at comforting when it comes to you. I like how you trusted me with this kind of things. I like how you dress up yourself when going out. I like how your smile brings joy. I like how I met you. I like  ̶h̶o̶w̶ you… your just being you :> If I summarize it, I guess it says I like everything about you?  
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; I also started to play codm since you play it too, I tried to invest myself to play it and really got addicted to it despite mainly plays MOBA game like League of legends and Mobile legends. I wanted to be good at it and capable of carrying you with my shotgun and sniper skills someday. Well guess what, I did it :> I guess you can say I did that so I can impress you, I do love to play with you again especially those Hide and seek we did together which is really fun to do :> Anyway here’s the recipe for brownies: 1/2cup butter 2eggs 1cup sugar 1/3cup cocoa powder 2teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2cup flour. If you have read this then you already made this far.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; I would like to thank you again for being my inspiration during these junior high days. I have learned lot of things in school and about you also. I still have things about to say but I'll just end it here. Also, thank you for accepting my selfish request that we take a photo together so I have a remembrance of you :> We do have a picture together in 7th grade though, you can see it in the next envelope. Thank you for going out with me to explore Sm Bf with. I enjoyed it don't worry and I like your outfit. Although, I can't say that in front of you because of how nervous I am around you... I also want to thank your mom or tita?? for taking the picture of us and joining with us together when I didn't really expect that part to happen. I kind of cringe on how I introduced on her instead of doing mano I did a formal way by shaking her hands. I have no regrets in meeting you :> If you ever feel down just remember that there is one person that believes in you and know you best that you’ll overcome these hardships :>
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Once again, this human humbly greets you a Happy Birthday!!
